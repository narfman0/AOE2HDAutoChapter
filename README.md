AOE2HDAutoChapter
=================

Automatically save an aoe2hd chapter every <period> minutes! 5 by default

Usage
-----

Install Autoit

Run bot.au3 by double clicking like an executable. Note: in your system tray there is now an autoit icon

The bot starts PAUSED. To unpause, press the F5 key. This toggles, so pause again with F5 and so on.

If you wish to adjust the interval, open bot.au3 and note the '5'. It's not an incredibly complex file :)

Enjoy! Chapter should be saved every <period> minutes! Hurrah!
